## what is 'bionoia'?

<div style="text-indent:-1em;padding-left:1em;">
<b>bio-</b> is a prefix that comes from the Greek word <i>bios</i> (meaning 'life'). Words that start with 'bio' involve life and living things, such as 'biology' (the study of living things), 'biography' (a written record of the life of a person), or 'biopsy' (to sample or examine living tissue).

<div style="text-indent:-1em;padding-left:1em;">
<b>-noia</b> is a suffix derived from the Greek word <i>noos</i> ('mind', 'thought', or 'intellect') combined with <i>-ia</i> (which refers to a state or condition). In contemporary English, it is used in words that describe a thought process or state of mind, such as 'paranoia' (a fearful or suspicious state of mind), 'hyponoia' (a fatigued or dulled mental state), or 'metanoia' (a reflective and transformative thought process).

As a researcher and educator, I spend a lot of time thinking about biology and thinking about how we're thinking about biology. Although *bionoia* is not a real word, it describes my very real, day-to-day state of mind. 

Do you like to think about living things? Are you interested in how we produce, discuss, and disseminate information about biology? If so, let's think about how we think about biology together!

## about me
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">
<img src="images/email_rainbow_scalable.svg" title="🧪🔬🧬👨🏻‍🔬" width="100%"/></p>
I am an interdisciplinary scholar whose contribtuion portfolio uniquely spans research in biology education, data science, epigenetics, and genomics. 

In biology education, I use both quantitative and qualitative methods to develop evidence-based pedagogy and increase the equity and accessibility of undergraduate biology programs. With a specific focus on LGBTQ+ equity, my prior work explores the presence and mechanisms of reinforcement of biological essentialism in the biology classroom using both qualitative interview and large-scale survey data. This academic work complements my practical experience as an instructor of record for an introductory biology course at UC Santa Barbara, where I apply and refine pedagogical best practices.

In molecular biology, I bring comprehensive expertise in NGS methodologies, from sample collection to advanced bioinformatics data analysis. My wet-lab skills are robust, encompassing mammalian tissue culture, RNA-seq, chromatin conformation capture, broad -omics interrogations, flow cytometry, and super-resolution imaging, alongside a broad range of general molecular biology techniques.

I am highly proficient in data analysis and visualization for both my biological and social research foci, leveraging R (`tidyverse`, Quarto), Python (`pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`), SQL, and Bash, with training in version control tools like `git`. To accomplish large-scale analyses, I utilize cloud computing applications including institutional Linux research clusters and AWS using job management and workload scheduler scripting. My integrated expertise positions me at the intersection of cutting-edge biological discovery and transformative justice in education.
