## abstract

### Background
Controversial issues are disputes that presently divide society, and which groups of people assert conflicting views or opinions. Instructors must juggle social dynamics when class content overlaps with social controversies, and many elect not to discuss related topics at all. Biology curriculum interacts with social controversies related to biological essentialism— the idea that traits of a person are innate biological essences—as well as other controversial topics like climate change or evolution. Preliminary data suggest that they perceive differences in intrinsic and extrinsic barriers when discussing content related to the LGBTQ+ community versus other topics. This project answers the research question: How do US post-secondary biology instructors conceptualize discussing gender and sexual orientation in class, compared to other topics like race, ability, climate change, or religion?

### Methods
A new analysis was performed on existing data derived from 1-hour long semi-structured interviews conducted with 13 instructors from various career stages and within one department at a single midwestern, research-focused institution. A constant comparison analysis methodology was used, involving initial familiarization, open coding, axial coding, and selective coding to generate a data-driven theory about the differences in instructor conceptions.

### Results
We observed differences in participants' comfort levels across socially controversial topics. For example, on the topic of discussing climate change in class, one participant said, “*So climate change is part of our unit on ecology and conservation here. I am pretty comfortable mentioning it offhand*”, and on race they said, “*So I talk about the reason why melanin in skin has been selected for in populations across the equator… And I try to talk about the problems of trying to categorize people by race, especially if you think it's biologically meaningful*”, while regarding discussing content about gender identity, they said in contrast, “*I think I'm probably more uncomfortable than my students usually when we're talking about that stuff*”. Instructors perceived their own demographic identities as a barrier whether they identified as within or outside of the LGBTQ+ community. We identified that instructors are considering the perception of risk, feeling of responsibility, and level self-preparation when deciding whether to discuss controversial topics in their courses.

### Significance
This novel study represents an early step in understanding the systemic conditions that marginalize LGBTQ+ individuals in the biological sciences. By understanding contrasts between different topics, future interventions can help biology departments train and support instructors to navigate polarized classroom discussions.

From [AERA "Who We Are"](https://www.aera.net/About-AERA/Who-We-Are "retrieved 2026-01-18."):

>The American Educational Research Association (AERA), founded in 1916, is concerned with improving the educational process by encouraging scholarly inquiry related to education and evaluation and by promoting the dissemination and practical application of research results.

>AERA's more than 25,000 members are faculty, researchers, graduate students, and other distinguished professionals with rich and diverse expertise in education research. They work in a range of settings from universities and other academic institutions to research institutes, federal and state agencies, school systems, testing companies, and nonprofit organizations. Based on their research, they produce and disseminate knowledge, refine methods and measures, and stimulate translation and practical application of research results.

>AERA is international in scope.  Nearly 14% of members, representing over 96 countries, reside outside the United States. Over 30% of AERA members are students—approximately 7,750 graduate students and 230 undergraduate students. Over three-quarters (78%) of AERA members report that education is the field of their highest degree. Other disciplines represented by AERA members include psychology, statistics, sociology, history, economics, philosophy, anthropology, and political science.
