## Central Valley Region Interdisciplinary Synposium on Education Research (CV-RISER)

From [CV-RISER 2022 conference description (UC Merced, 2022)](https://teach.ucmerced.edu/education-research/CV-RISER "retrieved 2025-12-20"):

>Providing students with a high-quality education is integral to the success of any college or university, and yet what makes teaching and learning effectively is not intuitive for most instructors. Evidenced-based education research is on the rise in many disciplines outside of Schools of Education and aims to identify effective instructional strategies and pedagogical approaches that facilitate deep learning. In the Central Valley of California, discipline-based education research (DBER) is still in its nascent stages, so it is critical to establish and nurture a community that focuses on evidence-based education principles and strategies that will positively impact the students across this region. Since all five institutions (California State University (CSU) Stanislaus, CSU Fresno, Fresno City College, Merced College, and UC Merced) are minority-serving institutions (MSIs), the potential to design rigorous research that addresses some of the most pressing needs for our student population is high.

>Education research is interdisciplinary by nature, requiring expertise in content, pedagogical methodologies, and empirical data collection and analysis. As a result, it relies on methods from diverse fields, such as psychology, economics, mathematics, computer science, cognitive science, sociology, engineering, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and biology. Even so, most college structures impede such interdisciplinary research, and the interdisciplinary connections necessary to carry out this research across the Central Valley are yet to be formed. CV-RISER offers an opportunity for interdisciplinary and cross-campus collaborations that will best meet the needs of the Central Valley student population.
