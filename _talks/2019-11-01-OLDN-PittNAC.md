From ['MCS Announces First Recipients of DSF Block Grants' (CMU, March 2018)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250910135433/https://www.cmu.edu/bio/news/2018/dsf_block_grant_announcement.html "Wayback Machine, retrieved 2025-12-20."):

>Organized by Subha R. Das, associate professor of chemistry, and Joel McManus, assistant professor of biological sciences, the Pittsburgh Nucleic Acids Club brings together research groups from around the region to discuss ongoing projects and preliminary data and facilitate the exchange of ideas and collaborative partnerships. The club also hosts summer Tools & Techniques workshops to provide hands-on training and foster collaborations.

>In addition to the early career/individual researcher and workshop grants, the block grant program will fund larger grants in the future for cross-disciplinary teams of scientists to leverage existing research in new directions and a $1 million “moonshot” grant that will support a high-risk, high-reward set of activities that brings together scientists from different fields to collaborate on scientifically challenging questions.

>MCS expects to fund the next round of block grants in the fall, application deadlines will be announced this summer.
