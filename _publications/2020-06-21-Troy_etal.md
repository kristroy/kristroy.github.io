# abstract

Disruption of chromatin structure could enable early carcinogenesis by facilitating malignant transformation. Using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy optimized for pathological tissue (PathSTORM), we uncovered a gradual decompaction of higher-order chromatin folding through progressive stages of carcinogenesis. We demonstrated potential detection of pre-cancerous genomic architecture not easily discernible by conventional pathology.
