### about
<p></p>

**[from course catalogue:](https://intro.biology.ucsb.edu/courses)**
>MCDB 1A is the first course in the Intro Bio lecture series, examining cellular biology, biochemistry, and genetics.

I was fortunate to be offered the opportunity to serve as the instructor for UCSB's introductory biology course in Summer 2025. Acting as the primary instructor for a course was a specific goal of mine in graduate school. To prepare for this opportunity, I participated in UCSB's Summer Teaching Institute for Associates (STIA), which provided detailed instruction, 1-on-1 mentorship, and course preparation workshops that supported me while teaching my first course.

I really enjoyed the experience! Now that I have made it through once and all the course materials are prepared, I would love the opportunity to apply my improvements while teaching the course again.
